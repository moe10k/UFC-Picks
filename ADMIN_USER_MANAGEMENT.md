## Frontend Components

### AdminUsers Page (`/admin/users`)

- Shows confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Visual distinction for different user roles

### AdminRoute Component
- Additional security wrapper for admin pages
- Checks admin/owner privileges before rendering
- Redirects non-admin users to dashboard

## Security Considerations

### Backend Security
1. **Middleware Protection**: All routes use `adminAuth` middleware (checks both admin and owner)
2. **Input Validation**: Express-validator for all inputs
3. **SQL Injection Prevention**: Sequelize ORM with parameterized queries
4. **JWT Verification**: Token validation on every request
5. **Error Handling**: Proper error responses without sensitive data
6. **Owner Protection**: Special logic to prevent owner account compromise

### Frontend Security
1. **Route Protection**: AdminRoute component prevents unauthorized access
2. **State Management**: Secure handling of user data
3. **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are properly validated
4. **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling
5. **Role-Based UI**: UI elements disabled based on user permissions

### Database Security
1. **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with salt rounds
2. **Field Exclusion**: Passwords excluded from user queries
3. **Indexing**: Proper database indexes for performance
4. **Transaction Safety**: Atomic operations where needed
5. **Owner Field**: New `isOwner` field for enhanced role management

## Monitoring and Logging

### Audit Logs
All admin actions are logged to the console:

Admin username (ID: 123) granted admin privileges for user targetuser (ID: 456)
Owner username (ID: 123) revoked admin privileges for user targetuser (ID: 456)
Admin username (ID: 123) activated user targetuser (ID: 456)
Owner username (ID: 123) deactivated user targetuser (ID: 456)
```

### Recommended Monitoring
- Monitor admin privilege changes
- Track owner account modifications

## Conclusion

The Admin User Management feature with Owner role provides a secure, efficient, and user-friendly way for administrators to manage user privileges. The implementation prioritizes security while maintaining excellent performance and usability. The Owner role ensures there's always a super-admin account that cannot be compromised, providing ultimate fallback authority for the system.
